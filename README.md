# Python Data Handling and Manipulation Examples

This repository contains Python code examples for handling and manipulating data, showcasing various techniques for working with data in a structured manner. The examples cover topics such as handling categorical variables, entity-attribute relationships, dealing with multivalued attributes, set operations, identifying unique values, graph data representation, handling tags or labels, and dealing with unique identifiers.

## 1. Handling Categorical Variables

This code demonstrates how to handle categorical variables in a dataset. It uses the pandas library to perform one-hot encoding on a 'City' column in an employee dataset.

## 2. Entity-Attribute Relationships

This section showcases the representation of entity-attribute relationships in a tabular format using pandas. It defines a table with attributes related to employees.

## 3. Dealing with Multivalued Attributes

This code segment focuses on dealing with multivalued attributes in a dataset. It represents employees' joining years and the courses they have taken in a tabular format using pandas.

## 4. Set Operations for Data Manipulation

Here, you can find examples of set operations such as union, intersection, difference, complement, and symmetric difference applied to different attributes in the employee dataset.

## 5. Identifying Unique Values

This code demonstrates how to identify unique values in various columns of the employee dataset, including education levels, joining years, cities, payment tiers, ages, genders, ever benched values, experience levels, and leave or not values.

## 6. Graph Data Representation

This section presents a simple graph data representation using a dictionary. It also includes a function to find neighbors of a given node and demonstrates adding an 'Age' node to the graph.

## 7. Handling Tags or Labels

The code here illustrates how to handle tags or labels associated with a dataset. It creates a modified dataset with tags and labels, and then filters and prints data for specific tags and labels.

## 8. Dealing with Unique Identifiers

This part of the repository shows how to deal with unique identifiers in a dataset. It creates a 'UniqueID' by concatenating row values and demonstrates finding a specific row based on a target unique identifier.

Feel free to explore these code examples and adapt them for your data handling and manipulation needs.
